# üß† Engineering Portfolio ‚Äì Sameer Jain

Welcome to my Engineering Portfolio.

This repository showcases a diverse collection of my engineering projects across mechanical design, embedded systems, control systems, simulation, software development, manufacturing, and systems integration. While I specialize in mechanical engineering, my experience spans the broader field of **mechatronics engineering** ‚Äî blending **mechanical design**, **electronics**, **software**, and **systems thinking** to create fully integrated solutions.
