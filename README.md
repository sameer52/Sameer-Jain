# üß† Engineering Portfolio ‚Äì Sameer Jain

Welcome to my Engineering Portfolio.

This repository showcases a diverse range of engineering projects that integrate mechanical design, electronics, control systems, software development, simulation, and manufacturing. While my foundation lies in mechanical engineering, my work extends into system-level thinking, such as bridging hardware and software to develop complete, functional solutions.
